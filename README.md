# QA Manual Portfolio — Sauce Demo

This repository demonstrates my manual QA approach using the Sauce Demo web app:
https://www.saucedemo.com/

## Goal
Validate the critical end-to-end user flow: login → browse products → cart → checkout → order confirmation.

## What’s included
- **Test-Strategy.md** — how and what I tested, scope, approach, prioritization
- **Risk-Analysis.md** — key risks with impact/likelihood and test focus
- **Smoke-Test-Checklist.md** — fast build verification for critical flow
- **Test-Cases/** — high-value functional test cases (cart + checkout)
- **Exploratory-Testing/** — charters and findings
- **Bug-Reports/** — bug report template and example(s)
- **Test-Summary-Report.md** — results and release-style summary

## Test approach
Risk-based testing with smoke + functional + exploratory coverage, focused on high-impact user and business risks.
